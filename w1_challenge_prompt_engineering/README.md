# TechStore Plus â€“ Customer Service Chatbot

The objective of this project is to create a customer service chatbot for TechStore Plus using Prompt Engineering techniques.

The chatbot greets users, collects basic customer information, identifies the type of inquiry (like technical support, billing, or returns), and routes the case accordingly. It also includes features like sentiment and emotion analysis, urgency detection, query classification, and entity extraction (e.g., product names or order numbers) to better understand and prioritize customer needs.
