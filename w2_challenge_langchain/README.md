# Advanced Customer Service Agent with LangChain

This project develops an **Advanced Customer Service Agent** for **TechStore Plus**, a fictional e-commerce company that provides technology products. It consists in creating an automated multi-step agent using the **LangChain framework**.

The core focus is to an application by leveraging **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** for chaining components, **Pydantic** for structured data handling, and **LangSmith** for tracing and debugging. 

The system processes user queries through multiple stages, including query analysis and classification, dynamic response generation, and conversation summarization and persistence.
